To help you use the codes here, please note:
1. numpy , keras , tensorflow and pandas are required in the environment.
2. All trainset should be put in a file_dir named 'train_val', if you want to change the file_dir you should change the 'file_dir' in the codes.
3. All testset should be put in a file_dir named 'test'. You can also change it if you want.
4. I recommend all the files to be put in the same file directionary and Visual Studio is also recommended.
5. These codes are just for classes. I do not expect that it will be useful for researchers.
